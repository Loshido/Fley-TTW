Truckers ðŸšš are the backbone of Transport Tycoon. â›½ Theyâ€™ve developed a complex web of cargo materials that allow you to simply sell one at a time, or collect and combine cargoes in multi-point routes for maximum profit!

### Getting Started

 1. Head to the Job Center and select the Trucker Job.
 2. Visit the Car Dealershio to purchase the Speedo Express or a combination of a semi-cab (truck) and trailer
     * The Speedo Express is free and has a trunk capacity equal to your own inventory capacity from 30kg to 300kg.

### Vehicles

Trucking requires a semi-cab (truck) and trailer to store cargo in. Semi-cabs can be bought from a car dealership or alternatively can be spawned at a few locations around the map.
